## How do I set this thing up??? ##
Aah, I'm so glad you asked

First. You gotta have node and npm installed, and on your path probably. Unless you like extra complications, then you're on your own

Then, make sure to
```
#!shell

npm install --global electron-prebuilt
```

From there, you can simply run (from the project's directory)
```
#!shell

npm install

npm start
```
And you're Off To The Races
